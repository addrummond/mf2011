On the interplay of syntax and semantics in representational NPs in Dutch, German and Finnish

<p>
This paper investigates the interpretation of different anaphoric
forms in representational noun phrases (RNPs, e.g. <i>picture of
her</i>/<i>herself</i>) in Dutch, German and Finnish. Existing research on
English (Kaiser, Runner, Sussman &amp; Tanenhaus 2009) found that the
interpretation of pronouns and reflexives in RNPs is sensitive to
syntactic as well as semantic properties of potential antecedents, and
that the relative contributions of syntactic vs. semantic factors are
different for pronouns and reflexives. The series of experiments
presented here &mdash; conducted in collaboration with Elsi Kaiser &mdash; provide
evidence for the cross-linguistic generality of the semantic effects
found for English and also show that the asymmetrical behavior of
pronouns and reflexives extends to other languages. In addition to
broadening our understanding of the cross-linguistic existence of
these patterns, we use languages with richer morphological paradigms
than English to investigate the sources of the semantic effects
exhibited by pronouns and reflexives. Our results indicate that at
least some of the constraints that guide the interpretation of
different anaphoric forms may be derivable from independently-observed
linguistic properties. I will also explore broader implications of
these findings for theories of reference resolution
