A formal approach to perspective taking in the acquisition of pronouns

<p>
In language acquisition, children’s performance in production and
their performance in comprehension do not always go hand in hand.
Particularly puzzling are situations where children’s production seems
to be ahead of their comprehension, such as with object pronouns. A
possible explanation for production/comprehension asymmetries is that
children as listeners are not yet able to take into account the
perspective of the speaker, and vice versa. Such perspective taking
can be formalized in terms of bidirectional Optimality Theory.
Considering both object pronouns and subject pronouns, I will present
the results from a series of studies using theoretical modeling,
computational simulations and psycholinguistic experiments that
provide support for this approach.
