What do pronouns mean when they cannot mean that much?

<p>
<i>Based on joint work with Marijana Marelj and Yoad Winter.</i>
</p>

<p>In this talk I will start with addressing the interpretation of
pronominals in Frisian and the anaphor <i>zich</i> in Dutch as objects of
&lsquo;inherently reflexive&rsquo; verbs. As discussed in Reinhart and Siloni
(2005), inherent reflexives arise from a lexical operation on argument
structure, in which the internal argument is reduced and the agent and
theme roles are bundled into a composite role assigned to the external
argument. Languages vary as to whether this operation does or doesn’t
leave a Case residue. In English it doesn’t, hence we find <i>Alice
washed</i> with a reflexive meaning.  In Dutch and Frisian it does, and a
simplex anaphor (Dutch) or a pronominal (Frisian) is inserted to check
the residual Case (Alice waste <i>zich</i>, <i>Alice waske har</i>). This
effectively makes the element inserted into an expletive. But what is
its semantics? Elaborating Jacobson (1999)’s approach to the semantics
of pronouns as (identity/proxy) functions along the lines in Reuland
and Winter (2009), it will be proposed that the non-argument character
of the relevant uses of such pronouns reduces to &lsquo;skipping&rsquo; the
predicate they check the Case of, and applying directly to the
external argument. This provides a unified semantics for their
argument and non-argument uses.

In the second part of the talk I will explore how this analysis
carries over to &lsquo;reflexive&rsquo; clitics (Romance, Slavic). I will first
discuss Reinhart and Siloni (2005)’s &lsquo;lexicon-syntax&rsquo; parameter, and
present a number of empirical reasons to reconsider it &mdash; starting from
and adding to the observations in Reuland 2008, and Labelle
2008). Some instances of reflexive clitics project an argument, others
don’t. The availability of proxy-readings serves as a litmus test for
argument hood. The puzzle originally motivating Reinhart and Siloni’s
lexicon-syntax parameter (Why is the distribution of Dutch <i>zich</i> in
reflexives lexically restricted, whereas the distribution of
Romance/Slavic <i>si</i>/<i>se</i> is not?) will be shown to reduce to a well-known
independent difference between clitics and other pronouns: the former
are categorically X<sup>0</sup>/XP, the latter just XP's. I will explore to what
extent the semantics of argument and non-argument uses of reflexive
clitics can be unified along the same lines as in the case of
non-clitic pronouns.
