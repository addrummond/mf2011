Bound Individual Variables in Pronouns: Are there any?

<p>
Pronouns are claimed to be covert definite descriptions containing a
locally free situation variable but no individual variables. Donkey
anaphora and related phenomena are analysed very much as in my book
Situations and Individuals (2005). C-commanded bound variable pronouns
are now analysed in the same way, i.e. by means of situation variables
being bound. Referential uses of pronouns involve these situation
variables being used referentially; and descriptive indexical uses (as
in Nunberg's work) involve descriptive content being contributed by
NP-deletion (which does not, of course, always require a linguistic
antecedent).
