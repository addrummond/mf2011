The Syntax of Pronoun Interpretation: Some Recurrent Themes

<p>
The interpretation of pronouns has been a central concern of
generative grammarians since the origins of the field. Among the major
topics have been locality (for reflexives) and anti-locality (for
pronouns); (near) complementarity between reflexives and pronouns; the
geometric relation between pronoun and potential antecedent (&lsquo;in
construction with&rsquo;, &lsquo;command&rsquo;, &lsquo;c-command&rsquo;); the ambiguity (or
vagueness?) of pronouns with respect to coreference and
non-coreference (&lsquo;Mary thinks she is a genius&rsquo;); the possibility -
impossibility of overlap in reference (&lsquo;he and she think they should
leave&rsquo; - &lsquo;They like him&rsquo;). I will discuss the development of analyses
of these phenomena, especially syntactic analyses, from the 1950's
through early Minimalism, examining changes and their motivation, and,
sometimes, returns to earlier conceptions.
