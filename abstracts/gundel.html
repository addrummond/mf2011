What are pronouns good for?

<p>
Pronouns as tools of reference are sometimes treated as carrying
little informational content that would guide their interpretation.
This paper presents an account of personal and demonstrative pronouns
that views them as belonging to a set of determiners which encode, as
part of their lexical meaning, the minimal cognitive status of the
intended referent, i.e. procedural information about how it is to be
mentally accessed by the addressee. Within this account, pronouns
actually provide stronger information that guides interpretation than
full DPs do, as they restrict the mental search space more. Syntactic
and semantic constraints that limit local and textual dependencies
between pronouns and their antecedents are consistent with such an
account, and complement it, but they are not viewed as primary. I will
also briefly discuss how this account can inform our understanding of
how pronouns are acquired  and used by children and how their use is
compromised in individuals diagnosed with autism.
