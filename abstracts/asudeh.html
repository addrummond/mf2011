Resumption and Composition

<p>
Grammatically licensed resumptive pronouns come in two main varieties,
which I call &lsquo;syntactically active resumptives&rsquo; and &lsquo;syntactically
inactive resumptives&rsquo;. The former variety behave like full pronouns in
the syntax, but the latter behave in many respects like
gaps. Nevertheless, even syntactically inactive resumptives are
interpreted like pronouns, where there are distinctions between the
interpretation of pronouns and gaps. This property of syntactically
inactive resumptives sheds new light on theories of semantic
composition. I will argue, based primarily on evidence from Swedish,
that the correct analysis of syntactically inactive resumptives
favours parallel composition theories (e.g., categorial grammar) over
interpretive composition theories (e.g., LF semantics).
