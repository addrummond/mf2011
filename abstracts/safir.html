Pronouns: Real and Apparent

<p>
In this talk I exploit the idea that some pronouns are constructed and
others are ‘native born’ with features as suggested in Kratzer (2009),
but unlike Kratzer, I suggest that all bound variable pronouns that
are traditionally bound (c-commanded) are the spell-out of a special,
but universally available, dependent form, which I call &lsquo;D-bound&rsquo;, the
unique universal anaphor. D-bound spells out differently depending on
when and how it is bound and agreed with. The idea is that the
phonological shape of surface pronouns has two origins: Either the
universal bound form D-bound is given pronominal shape as a default
and random phi-features if it is not bound at the end of a phase, or
it is given the shape of a local bindee if bound within a phase.
D-bound, however, is never well-formed if free (even when it looks
like a pronoun). Binding requires feature compatibility wherever it
holds, however compatibility is achieved (unification, matching,
non-conflict) as conditioned by local or default shape and the nature
of the antecedent. Native born pronouns and names are thus always free
wherever they would compete with D-bound, which restores Principle C
to a simple reflex of lost competition to the bound form, except that
native-born pronouns and names have exactly the same status for
obviation in this theory (they both lose to D-bound). By contrast,
&lsquo;almost c-command&rsquo; bound variable pronouns are treated here as true
pronouns, which presumably have to be shifted or re-featured under
binding, but this operation is only available where D-bound would not
be well-formed (and so this sort of binding does not induce
obviation). The existence of local anaphoric shape is thus not
expected to be a universal, though there are functional pressures for
local anaphora resolution that can exploit phase-internal binding.
Arguments that local binding should reduce to Agree (locally), or that
distance binding should reduce to context shift, are rejected, but the
role of heads in effecting binding as in Kratzer (2009) is adopted,
primarily as binding by Spec v as effected by v.
