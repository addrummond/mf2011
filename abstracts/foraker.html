Who are you talking about? The role of prominence in pronoun resolution 

<p>
Understanding dependencies in language, such as that between a pronoun
and its antecedent, relies on memory operations. Readers and listeners
need access to previously processed information to link and resolve
the coreference. Previous research shows that a pronoun referring back
to a prominent antecedent is easier to comprehend compared to when the
antecedent is not prominent in the discourse. I will present
psycholinguistic experiments that manipulate the prominence of
antecedents through clefting structures or prosodic emphasis, testing
which of two possible cognitive mechanisms underlie the prominence
advantage. Results indicate that prominence facilitates pronoun
resolution by increasing the distinctiveness of an antecedent
representation in memory, thereby facilitating its retrieval at the
pronoun. Pronoun resolution does not appear to depend on active
maintenance of the prominent entity in focal attention, a variant of
the active-filler hypothesis. These results hold for pronouns that are
relatively unambiguous in the discourse as well as more ambiguous
ones.
