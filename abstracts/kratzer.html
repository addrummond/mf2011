Predicting the space of possible pronouns

<p>
The talk will explore some consequences of my 2008 paper <i>Making a
Pronoun</i> for predicting the range of possible bound variable pronouns
in natural languages. The major claims are (a) that all bound pronouns
are born alike, (b) that the binders for bound variable pronouns are
not carried by antecedent DPs, but by functional heads like v or C,
and that (c) bound variables acquire the characteristic looks of
personal, reflexive, or relative pronouns, for example, from the
functional heads that carry their binders.
