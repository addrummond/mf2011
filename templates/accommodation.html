specify which nights you will be staying over on
the <a href="$url_for('/register')">registration</a> page as early as
is possible. A block of rooms have been reserved at the Quality Inn
for check-in May 7th and checking out May 10th, with the special price
for a single room at $84 and a double room at $89 per night. Please
mention the group name &lsquo;Mayfest&rsquo; when booking. Rooms at these prices
must be booked before April 23, after this the rooms will depend on
availability.

<h3>Hotels in DC</h3>
<p>
College Park is metro-accessible, so it is easy to get to the conference from DC.
This is quicker from hotels near metro stations on the green line
(e.g. L'Enfant Plaza, Navy Archives, Gallery Place, Mt Vernon Square, Shaw Howard, U Street).
See <a href="$url_for('/directions#metrotravel')">directions</a> for more information.
